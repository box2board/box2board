    <section id="causes">
      <h2>Causes of the French Revolution</h2>
      <p>By 1789, France faced deep social inequality, crushing debt, Enlightenment influences, and royal mismanagement. The Three Estates system granted privileges to the clergy and nobility, while the Third Estate—98% of the population—shouldered taxes and had no voice in government.</p>
      <blockquote>“Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.” – Declaration of the Rights of Man (1789)</blockquote>
      <p>The Enlightenment encouraged people to question the monarchy’s legitimacy, and the costly American Revolution pushed France toward bankruptcy. King Louis XVI’s indecision and resistance to reform made revolution all but inevitable.</p>

    <section id="napoleon">
      <h2>Napoleon’s Rise, Reforms, and Fall</h2>
      <p>Napoleon Bonaparte seized power in 1799, ending the revolution. As Emperor, he introduced the Napoleonic Code, centralized the government, reformed education, and conquered much of Europe. His failed invasion of Russia in 1812 marked his decline.</p>
      <p>Defeated at Waterloo in 1815, Napoleon was exiled permanently. Despite his authoritarian rule, many revolutionary reforms remained in place, including legal equality and secular governance.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="legacy">
      <h2>Legacy and Global Impact</h2>
      <p>The Revolution abolished feudalism and inspired democratic movements worldwide. It contributed to Haitian independence, Latin American revolutions, and long-term shifts toward representative government in Europe. The ideals of liberty, equality, and nationalism shaped the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
